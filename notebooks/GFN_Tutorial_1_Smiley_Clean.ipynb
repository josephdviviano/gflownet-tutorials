        "Each environment in torchgfn must generate an instance of the `States` class, which (in the discrete case) uses `masks` to define allowable actions, define whether the trajectory is complete, and backward actions to reach parent states. In `torchgfn` the forward action space (which in our case is the addition of 1 out of 6 facial features) has an additional *exit action*, which the framework uses to end a trajectory. The sampling process continues until all batch elements have exited. In our case, all trajectories are exactly length 3, so this is simple: we mask out the exit action until 3 non-exit actions have been selected, and then we mask all actions *except* exit to ensure the trajectory terminates.\n",

        "\n",
        "We also define the `reward` using vectorized logic. Note that `torchgfn` uses `log_rewards()` internally, and since we have a reward of `0`, we must clip the `log_reward` (since `log(0) = -inf`). This clipping is handled automatically for us, and the clipping can be tuned using the `log_reward_clip` flag if so desired."
